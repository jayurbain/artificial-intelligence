    "OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms that includes many game environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a tutorial with a minimal sample implementation of the Deep Q-Learning alogrithm for reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uses the Keras Deep Learning library and the OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solves the cart-pole game, however it can be easily adapted to other Gym games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The training might be unstable for basic deep q-learning. This problem could be mitigated by using dualing deep q-learning. \n",
