So random moves get no rewards but by luck (brute force enough tries) the state/action is found where a reward is given. So next game the immediate actions preceding this state/action will direct toward it by use of the Q-Matrix. The next iteration the actions before that, etc, etc. In other words, it solves \"the puzzle\" backwards from end-result (drop-off passenger) towards steps to be taken to get there in a iterative fashion.  \n",

However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend.\"  \n",
